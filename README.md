## Overview

SmartFusion 2 FPGAs are low-density devices with the lowest power, proven security, and exceptional reliability for general-purpose functions. The way in which particles interact with semiconductors is diverse. These interactions can be cumulative or instantaneous. As described by the schematic presented by Campola and Pellish shown in Figure 1 three major interactions are the recombination of electron-hole pairs, nuclear displacement regarding lattice disruption and vacancies, and oxide-charge trapping due to the imperfection of interfaces.

### Degradation
Cumulative effects are often referred to as Total Ionizing Dose (TID) or Total Non-Ionizing Dose
(TNID) and are commonly measured in krad units and particles over cm2 respectively. These effects
are manifested as the degradation of given parts or components. The contribution of cumulative
effects is highly dependent on the environment and the duration in their presence. In a way, both
doses mimic the aging of the components. Therefore, they can lead to wear-out and degradation on
component operations

### Instantaneous

It is the manifestation of the effect of one particle creating a single-event. They can be divided into
destructive and non-destructive. The contribution for single-events are protons, heavy ions, electrons,
and muons. These particles are random by nature, they are characterized by having sufficient charge
along their path penetrating through a sensitive structure. Figure 2 is a brief compilation of failure
modes in different technologies [2]. The table includes some important destructive SEE modes such
as single-event latchup, single-event gate rupture, or single-event burnout.
